# Board Revisions
There are a number of board and carrier card revisions which I am not going to
try to keep track of.  For my own reference, the versions that I'll be working
with are the following

The FMC carrier card has the following markings
MBCC-FMC-PCB-B FMC Carrier Card rev. B
HKADS-13-07-HW-0201

BD-Z7MB-7Z010-G-REVF-07 (white label on reverse)
Z7MB-7Z0x0-PCB-F (screened on below the solder mask)

So, as a simple reminder, unless otherwise stated, everything in this repository
is applicable to the Avnet MicroZed 7010 (rev F) and an Avnet FMC carrier card
(rev B).  When I get around to needing to worry about the memory on the board,
I will note that later.
